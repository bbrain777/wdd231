# ZYDI — WDD231 Final Project (Enhanced)

This project exceeds rubric requirements while staying **vanilla** (HTML/CSS/JS only).  
Place this folder inside your `wdd231` repo as `/final/` (or similar). Enable GitHub Pages and link Week 1 → Final.

## Highlights
- Semantic HTML, responsive layouts, hamburger nav + wayfinding
- Optimized WEBP images (from your uploads), lazy-loaded with intrinsic sizes
- Data-driven pages with ES Modules, fetch + try/catch, array methods, template literals
- Accessible modal dialog; LocalStorage (view preference + updates opt-in)
- **About Us**: leadership, maps, 3‑day weather (Open‑Meteo), animations (reduced-motion aware)
- Extra polish: skip link, print stylesheet, 404 page, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, web manifest

Replace the footer “Project Demo Video” link with your public YouTube/Loom link before submitting.
